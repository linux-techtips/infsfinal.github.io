![The Green Grid](https://www.snia.org/sites/default/files/about/alliances/tgg_logo_1.png)

[The Green Grid](https://www.snia.org/about/alliances/green_grid) is a global consortium of companies and organizations that are committed to advancing energy efficiency in data centers and other computing environments. While the primary focus of The Green Grid is on reducing the environmental impact of computing, the organization also recognizes the importance of cybersecurity in data center operations. By promoting best practices in energy efficiency, The Green Grid helps to reduce the risk of cybersecurity breaches that can result from poorly designed or maintained computing environments. 

For example, data centers that are not properly cooled or ventilated can become hot spots for cyberattacks, as the heat can cause hardware failures or make it easier for attackers to gain access to sensitive systems. By promoting the use of energy-efficient cooling and ventilation systems, The Green Grid helps to minimize these risks and improve the overall security of data centers. 

Here as some steps Companies can take to apply the Green Grid to their data centers: 
 
- __Collaborating__: The Green Grid brings together leading technology companies, government agencies, and non-profit organizations to collaborate on developing best practices for energy efficiency in data centers and computing environments. 

- __Developing Standards__: The organization develops and promotes a range of standards and best practices for energy efficiency in data centers, including the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) metric, which measures the ratio of total energy used by a data center to the energy used by its IT equipment. 
 
- __Providing Resources__: The Green Grid provides a range of resources and tools to help organizations assess and improve the energy efficiency of their data centers, including a PUE calculator, energy efficiency guidelines, and case studies of successful energy efficiency initiatives. 

- __Raising Awareness__: The Green Grid raises awareness of the importance of energy efficiency in computing environments through educational programs, events, and research initiatives. 

- __Monitoring Progress__: The organization monitors and reports on the progress of its members and the industry as a whole in improving energy efficiency in data centers, and provides guidance and support to help organizations achieve their energy efficiency goals. 

Overall, The Green Grid plays an important role in promoting both energy efficiency and cybersecurity in data centers and other computing environments. By promoting best practices and sharing knowledge and expertise, The Green Grid helps organizations to build more resilient and sustainable computing environments, while also reducing the risk of cyberattacks and data breaches.

[Energy Star for Data Centers](https://www.energystar.gov/products/data_centers) is a certification program developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency __(EPA)__ that recognizes energy-efficient data centers and provides guidance on best practices for energy efficiency in data center operations. While the primary focus of Energy Star for Data Centers is on reducing energy consumption and environmental impact, the program also recognizes the importance of cybersecurity in data center operations. By promoting energy-efficient design and management practices, Energy Star for Data Centers can help to reduce the risk of cybersecurity breaches that can result from poorly designed or maintained computing environments. For example, data centers that are not properly cooled or ventilated can become hot spots for cyberattacks, as the heat can cause hardware failures or make it easier for attackers to gain access to sensitive systems. By promoting energy-efficient cooling and ventilation systems, Energy Star for Data Centers helps to minimize these risks and improve the overall security of data centers.  

Here as some steps Companies can take to apply the Energy Star to their data centers: 

- __Benchmarking__: Energy Star for Data Centers provides a benchmarking tool that allows data center managers to compare the energy efficiency of their facilities to others in the industry. 

- __Improving Energy Efficiency__: The program provides guidance on best practices for improving energy efficiency in data center operations, including strategies for improving cooling and ventilation systems, optimizing IT hardware and software, and reducing energy waste through effective management and monitoring. 

- __Certification__: Data centers that meet the Energy Star efficiency criteria can apply for certification, which includes a rigorous evaluation of their energy efficiency practices and verification of their energy consumption data. 

- __Recognition__: Certified data centers are recognized by Energy Star and can use the Energy Star label to promote their energy efficiency to customers, investors, and other stakeholders. 

- __Continuous Improvement__: Energy Star for Data Centers encourages continuous improvement by providing ongoing support and resources to certified facilities, including access to best practices, benchmarking data, and technical assistance. 

Overall, Energy Star for Data Centers is an important program for promoting both energy efficiency and cybersecurity in data center operations, and can help organizations to build more sustainable and secure computing environments.
